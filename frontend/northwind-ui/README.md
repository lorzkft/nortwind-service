# Further Development Possibilities

While the current implementation provides a basic product table, there are several enhancements:

## 1. Pagination
## 2. Use Paid OData-Related DataTable Components
Consider using paid or premium OData-related data table components, such as `@mui/x-data-grid-pro` or other third-party DataTable libraries, to access more advanced features like advanced filtering, grouping, and additional customization options.
## 3. Action Filter or Wrapper for Result Set
## 4. Many others
